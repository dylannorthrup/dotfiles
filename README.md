# NOTE: This repo is a lagging mirror

I've moved to using [chezmoi](https://chezmoi.io) for my "dotfile management". I'll do my best to synchronize the changes I make there with the contents here for non-sensitive files. Unless I take the time to automate that, any synchronization will be mostly manual and done when I am wanting to make a thing available to someone else that hasn't been sync'd yet.
